    <h2 class="section-header">About Me</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      Hello! I'm Tanbol Erlan, a cloud enthusiast with a recent AWS Solutions
      Architect Associate certification. Thrilled to share my AWS Cloud
      Practitioner and Solutions Architect journey. I'm applying this expertise
      to real-world scenarios, reinforcing my understanding of best practices.
      <br />
      <br />
      As of January, I'm actively seeking opportunities in cloud architecture.
      I'm drawn to challenges involving architecting and optimizing scalable,
      secure, and high-performance cloud solutions.
      <br />
      <br />
      Open to networking with cloud professionals and organizations aligned with
      my goals. Let's connect for discussions on cloud architecture, best
      practices, or potential collaborations. Excited to contribute to
      innovative projects and continue the journey of learning and innovation in
      the cloud space!

    <h2 class="section-header">About the Website</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      Welcome to my digital space—a personal project hosted on AWS as part of
      the Cloud Resume Challenge. Crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this
      site is more than a static resume; it's a showcase of my technical skills
      and passion for web development.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the cloud, this site utilizes AWS services like Amazon S3 for storage
      and CloudFront for efficient global content delivery. Serverless computing
      through AWS Lambda ensures seamless scalability, while DynamoDB handles
      dynamic data.
      <br />
      <br />
      With Infrastructure as Code principles using CloudFormation scripts, I've
      sculpted this virtual haven. Git ensures version control integrity,
      capturing every evolution of this digital realm.
      <br />
      <br />
      As you explore, know that this site is not just a snapshot of my
      professional journey; it's a testament to my proficiency in the tools of
      the trade. Enjoy the content, and feel free to connect. This digital
      presence is more than a resume—it's a reflection of my dedication to
      technology and the ever-evolving landscape of the cloud.
