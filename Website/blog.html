          Greetings,
          <br />
          <br />
          As I usher in the new year, I'm excited to share a bit more about
          myself and the unexpected twists of my professional journey. I'm
          Tanbol, and if you're wondering how a biology enthusiast ended up
          navigating the vast landscapes of technology, buckle up for a quick
          ride into the clouds.
          <br />
          <br />
          My academic journey took me from being a biology geek to delving deep
          into the realms of Pharmacology and Toxicology for my master’s. As I
          penned a thesis on bladder cancer, the limitations of traditional wet
          lab work in biomedical research became apparent. That's when I decided
          to hack the system.
          <br />
          <br />
          Venturing into programming and bioinformatics, I discovered the
          transformative power of coding – an unsung hero in our modern world.
          Post-master’s, I immersed myself in learning Python, algorithms,
          databases, and Genomic data science. With no prior Computer Science
          background and minimal stats experience, the learning curve felt like
          mastering a new language. But challenges only fueled my determination.
          <br />
          <br />
          After a stint as a Teaching Assistant and a detour into medical device
          sales for a Chinese company in Kazakhstan, I found myself at a
          crossroads. The constant travel, bureaucratic hurdles, and a saturated
          market led me to seek a new horizon.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fast forward to November 2023 – I summoned the courage to embark on a
          new chapter as a cloud engineer. And this is where my personal website
          comes into play. It's more than just a static resume; it's a digital
          diary chronicling my highs, lows, and discoveries as I navigate the
          clouds.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, welcome to my digital space, where biology meets bytes, and I
          document the chapters of my cloud journey. Join me on this adventure
          filled with serverless wonders, code snippets, and the thrill of
          mastering a new set of skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cheers to the journey ahead!

      Navigating the Cloud: My AWS Certification Journey
    </h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      Embark on a riveting adventure as I unveil my journey to conquer AWS
      certifications—where excitement meets challenges in the cloud's intricate
      labyrinth. From decoding serverless wonders to embracing the AWS Solutions
      Architect Associate realm, this blog post is a thrilling chronicle of
      navigating the digital skies, acknowledging that certificates are but a
      compass in the boundless landscape of cloud expertise.

        <p class="section-text">
          Hey Cloud Enthusiasts,
          <br />
          <br />
          Buckle up as I unravel the exhilarating adventure of studying for AWS
          certifications—a journey marked by excitement, challenges, and a
          profound commitment to mastering the cloud.
          <br />
          <br />
          Having recently earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions
          Architect Associate certifications, the thrill of delving into the
          intricacies of cloud computing is still palpable. From the
          foundational AWS Cloud Practitioner exam to the more complex Solutions
          Architect Associate certification, each step was a leap into a realm
          where serverless wonders and scalable architectures awaited.
          <br />
          <br />
          The excitement was infectious, but it came hand-in-hand with
          challenges. AWS exams are no walk in the park. With each
          certification, I faced the daunting task of mastering an extensive
          array of services, understanding architectural best practices, and
          applying my knowledge to real-world scenarios. The complexity blew my
          mind, much like the intricate paths of a labyrinth in the digital
          realm.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, every challenge was met with an equal measure of
          determination. Late nights deciphering AWS documentation, hands-on
          labs to solidify theoretical concepts, and countless practice exams
          became the norm. The process wasn't just about passing exams; it was a
          journey of self-discovery, pushing boundaries, and honing a skill set
          that's shaping the future of technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          Yet, it's crucial to acknowledge that certifications alone don't
          define expertise. They're a stepping stone, a compass guiding us
          through the vast AWS landscape. What truly matters is the hands-on
          experience, the ability to architect robust solutions, and the agility
          to adapt to the ever-evolving cloud ecosystem.
          <br />
          <br />
          In essence, certifications are a valuable tool for learning and
          practicing the knowledge gained. They provide structure to our cloud
          education, allowing us to systematically explore the vast AWS
          services. It's not just about obtaining a badge; it's about embracing
          the mindset of a cloud architect, understanding the nuances of cloud
          design, and gaining confidence in navigating the AWS console.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, if you're contemplating the AWS certification journey, remember
          that the value lies not just in the certification itself, but in the
          learning process, the practical application of knowledge, and the
          continuous pursuit of excellence in cloud architecture.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here's to the cloud journey—a path of challenges, triumphs, and the
          relentless pursuit of knowledge!
          <br />
          <br />

          Cheers,

          Hey Cloud Enthusiasts,
          <br />
          <br />
          I recently embarked on the Cloud Resume Challenge, a thrilling odyssey
          on AWS that took me from certified cloud explorer to novice programmer
          and designer. Buckle up as I share the highs, lows, and the exciting
          journey of delving into the world of HTML, CSS, and JS without a prior
          clue.
          <br />
          <br />
          The challenge kicked off with a seemingly insurmountable task for an
          inexperienced coder like me—designing a functional website. As someone
          who didn't even know what HTML, CSS, or JS stood for, the journey
          began with deciphering the alphabet soup of web development. The
          struggle was real, but so was the excitement of unraveling the
          mysteries behind the front-end wizardry that powers websites and web
          applications.
          <br />
          <br />
          The coding journey was a rollercoaster of trial and error, late-night
          Google searches, and the occasional frustration of a misplaced
          semicolon. From the initial confusion of divs and spans to the moment
          when I realized the power of JavaScript in making pages come alive,
          every line of code became a victory.
          <br />
          <br />
          Surprisingly, the other aspects of the challenge felt like a walk in
          the cloud, thanks to my experience during the study for the Solutions
          Architect certification. Navigating AWS services, understanding
          architectural principles, and optimizing for scalability were realms I
          had recently conquered, making these components of the challenge a
          breeze.
          <br />
          <br />
          This blog post is a candid account of my transformation from a
          certified cloud professional to a fledgling web developer. It's a
          testament to the resilience required to learn a new language—the
          language of code—and the satisfaction that comes with seeing your
          ideas take shape on a webpage.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, if you're contemplating the Cloud Resume Challenge or diving into
